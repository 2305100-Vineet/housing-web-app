## 📋 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1 — Customer Master Creation `XD01`
Stores customer address, payment terms, reconciliation account (FI), and sales area data. Mandatory before any sales document can be created. Ensures every customer transaction is linked to the correct FI reconciliation account for automatic AR postings.

---

### Step 2 — Material Master `MM01`
Captures product data across SD, MM, and MRP views. The Sales Org. view defines the delivering plant and item category group. The MRP view governs replenishment logic and planned delivery time.

---

### Step 3 — Inquiry & Quotation `VA11` / `VA21`
A customer Inquiry captures product interest without commitment. The system generates a formal Quotation with agreed pricing and validity period, which is directly referenced when creating the Sales Order — maintaining full document traceability.

---

### Step 4 — Sales Order Creation `VA01`
The central O2C document (document type: **OR**). Captures sold-to/ship-to party, line items, pricing conditions, payment terms, and incoterms. All downstream documents (delivery, invoice) are created with reference to the Sales Order, forming a complete, auditable document chain.

---

### Step 5 — Availability Check / ATP `CO09`
SAP automatically runs **Available-to-Promise (ATP)** logic at order save — checking stock against confirmed demands (purchase orders, reservations, deliveries) to commit a reliable delivery date. Prevents overselling and sets accurate customer expectations.

---

### Step 6 — Outbound Delivery `VL01N` / `VL02N`
Delivery document triggers warehouse picking and packing. **Post Goods Issue (PGI)** simultaneously:
- **MM:** Reduces inventory stock
- **FI:** Auto-posts `Debit COGS` / `Credit Inventory` — no manual FI entry needed
- Unlocks the billing due list for invoice creation

---

### Step 7 — Billing & Payment `VF01` / `F-28`
VF01 generates the customer invoice, posting:
- `Debit Accounts Receivable` / `Credit Revenue` — simultaneously in FI

Output determination framework auto-generates and sends the invoice PDF. Payment received via F-28 clears the open AR item, completing the O2C cycle.

> 🔗 Complete document chain: **Inquiry → Quotation → Sales Order → Delivery → PGI → Invoice → Payment** — permanently linked and auditable in SAP.

## 📊 Financial Accounting Flow

```
POST GOODS ISSUE (VL02N)
    Debit  → Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)     (Expense recognized)
    Credit → Inventory Account             (Stock reduced)

BILLING DOCUMENT (VF01)
    Debit  → Accounts Receivable (AR)      (Customer owes money)
    Credit → Revenue Account               (Revenue recognized)

INCOMING PAYMENT (F-28)
    Debit  → Bank / Cash Account           (Payment received)
    Credit → Accounts Receivable (AR)      (Open item cleared)
```

## 📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete SAP SD Order-to-Cash cycle — from organizational structure setup and master data (XD01, MM01) through inquiry and quotation (VA11/VA21), sales order (VA01), ATP check (CO09), outbound delivery with PGI (VL01N), billing (VF01), to final payment clearing (F-28).

The interaction between SAP SD, MM, FI, and WM modules highlights SAP's capability to transform traditionally fragmented manual processes into a **unified, real-time, and audit-ready framework** — a core competency developed through the SAP Data/Analytics Engineer program at KIIT.
